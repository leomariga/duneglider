# Dune Glider
This repository contains an open-source development of a small glider model in python. The goal is to have fun with aerodynamic and physics related to aircraft optimization and modeling.

Dune Glider is small wing used in sandboard. The goal is to create lift during a descent slope and glide during a slow drop from a dune. The goal is not to have a super high lift such as hang gliders, but a small, fun (and mostly safe) drop. This concept can also be applied snowboard. Some people is already trying concepts like this using REEDIN SUPERWING models, but this is not exactly optimizd for this purposes.
